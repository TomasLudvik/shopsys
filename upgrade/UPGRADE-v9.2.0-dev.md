# [Upgrade from v9.1.0 to v9.2.0-dev](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/compare/v9.1.0...master)

This guide contains instructions to upgrade from version v9.1.0 to v9.2.0-dev.

**Before you start, don't forget to take a look at [general instructions](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/blob/7.3/UPGRADE.md) about upgrading.**
There you can find links to upgrade notes for other versions too.

## Application
- use different css classes for javascript and tests ([#2179](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2179))
    - see #project-base-diff to update your project

- all fields defined in GraphQL type `Product` are correctly inherited in `RegularProduct`, `Variant`, `MainVariant` types ([#2195](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/2195))
    - if you extended `Product` type, you could remove duplicate definitions in `RegularProduct`, `Variant`, `MainVariant` types
